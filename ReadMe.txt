The software can only be used on a computer with Python IDLE installed.
Two packages will also need to be installed.
Type 'cmd' into the windows search bar.
Then type 'pip install pandas' and press enter.
Allow Pandas to install.
Then type 'pip install openpyxl' and press enter.
Allow openpyxl to install.
Then type 'exit' and press enter.
The software should then be usable.
Have fun.
